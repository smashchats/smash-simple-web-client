- Writing beautiful code is important. It needs to be easily readable by a junior engineer, with the flattest learning-curve possible.
- All component props are wrapped around `Readonly<T>`.
- We're writting functional code whenever possible.
- Short files are easier to read and understand, hence this is one of our goals.
- Variable names should be as explicit as possible. We don't write `i` when we can write `index`. We're not lazy. It's better to have a 40-character name for a variable than something we won't understand the next day.
