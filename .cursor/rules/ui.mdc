- All UI you implement is clean and sober.
- You don't use emojis. You use lucide-react icons.
- Tailwind css is available. Use tailwind classes when available. Don't hesitate to refactor historic styles that are inline or in a separate file. 
- there are variables in [globals.css](mdc:src/styles/globals.css) that you must use in all components and screens styles.
- you must reuse components in [components](mdc:src/components).
