- You should avoid repeating code at all costs. Everytime you do, a kitten chokes on it.
- When a function becomes a little bit too much complicated, it should be split.
- Consider for new helper functions if a hook is something we might want to have.
- Is there any other file using something similar? Might be a good time to refactor what you're doing.
